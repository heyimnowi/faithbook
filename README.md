# Faithbook

Faithbook is an application that brings people from different religious backgrounds together with the goal of fostering interfaith and intercultural interactions. 

The app has two types of users: *Newcomers* and *Locals*.  
Newcomers are represented by refugees or migrants trying to find a way to connect to their new environment, and also by tourists trying to find out more about the religion and culture of the place they are visiting.  
Locals are people who have spent an extensive period of time in a specific location and who are willing to share insight into their religion and find out more about the faiths of others.

We believe that faith is one of the main driving forces of a sense of community and shared values, and that having this sort of dialogue would help better integrate people into new environments.
